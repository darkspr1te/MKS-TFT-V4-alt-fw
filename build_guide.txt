in your arduino IDE add 
https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/master/STM32/package_stm_index.json
to additional board manager URLS and then add stm32 board from board manager if you dont have current stm32 duino installed


add the board to boards.txt , normally located in 
C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\STM32\hardware\stm32\1.7.0\boards.txt
user the text in board_additions.txt and add to boards.txt un generic flight menu section , around line #1235 on v1.7.0 of stm32duino 

the ver 1.7.0 may change, be warned line numbers also.

copy the MKSTFT_F107VC folder to variants folder ,
normally located in 
C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\STM32\hardware\stm32\1.7.0\variants

select blink test app
if you have stm build tools installed select swd as programmer 
if you dont have stmb32tools use bmp(black magic probe) as build option  

compile , copy the resulting bin file to sd-card, rename to mkstft28.bin
normally the bin file is in
